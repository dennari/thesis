%% Preface
This master's thesis was the culmination of the learning
which eventually took place while I was working in 
the Bayesian Statistical 
Methods group in the Department of Biomedical 
Engineering and Computational Science at Aalto University, Finland.

I wish to express my sincere gratitude for the guidance and
expert advice offered by my instructor D.Sc.\ (Tech.) 
Simo Särkkä. I am also deeply grateful to my supervisor 
Prof. Jouko Lampinen for his patience
in the delicate process which was the completion of this thesis.
Furthermore, I am indebted to my dear colleague 
M.Sc.\ (Tech.) Arno Solin who generously offered both his
time and considerable expertise for making this thesis
better.

Finally, I would like to acknowledge my appreciation
to my friends and my family for the support and understanding 
I received when I felt discouraged.
